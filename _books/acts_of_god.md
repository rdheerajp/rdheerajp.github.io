*Log line:* A Genius (Cat III) moves in and out of the frame, stumbles across the stage of life while fighting with hallucinations.

*About the author:* Comedian Kanan Gill's finally gives into his love of writing and explores a sincere story by letting the characters move around freely. 

*Thoughts:* 
- Kanan's debut book 'Acts of God' shines a light on dark subjects- by that I mean Manjunath, not mortality and lack of purpose.
- A South Indian scientist with little respect to the authority is not that relatable after all.
