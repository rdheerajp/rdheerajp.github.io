_Log line:_ A book that challenges our understanding of the world and a book.

_About the author:_ Benjamin Labatut wrote the book originally in Spanish, titled 'Un verdor terrible'. It was translated by Adrian N. West into English.

_Thoughts:_

- This book is a fictional retelling of historical scientists living on the cutting-edge of knowledge. The biographies are easier to digest if we imagine the stories set in a imaginary world, but shares uncanny similarities with reality.
