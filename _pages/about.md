### Hello!

Call me Raghavendra Dheeraj or call me curious! 

I am a engineer-turned-researcher, working in the intersection of mathematics, physics, and computer science. My primary work involves developing quantum-inspired algorithms.

Here, you will find a blend of my work and my thoughts. I attribute value to neither of them.
