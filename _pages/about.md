**Hello!**

Call me Raghavendra Dheeraj, or call me curious! 

I am an engineer-turned-researcher, working in the intersection of mathematics, physics, and computer science.
My primary focus is on developing quantum-inspired algorithms.

In this space, you will discover a blend of my work and personal reflections.
Each piece shows my thoughts and experiences. I do not see them as having special value;
instead, they are a record of my journey.
