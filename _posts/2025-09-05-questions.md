Welcome to 'tilted' - an assortment of random thoughts.

I will go over my several attempts of writing this very post before settling on answering my own questions.

## Timeline

I take a brisk walk through the years to set the context.

- 2020: The world pauses. Attempt 1 at a personal page.
- 2021: Hectic year. Graduation. Work. Leaving for a Masters.
- 2022: More work. Attempt 2 at a personal page.
- 2023:
- 2024: Finally, started working on this page.
- 2025: I guess this counts as a successful attempt.

#### Q. tilted? why?

The blog is titled 'tilted'. Truth be told, it started with a typo. Now, I have a lot of justifications for this happy accident.

First, the intention of this space is to share my perspective. The objective is to give room for subjectivity and bias, while maintaining openness and transparency.

Second, I play and watch a lot of chess. There, the term 'being on a tilt' refers to the frustation from a streak of losing. Nothing could capture the timeline of constant failure better. However, now that I have acknowledged the failures, I hope that the learnings will help me out. Fingers crossed.

    1. Write. I shall write apologetically and unapologetically.

[^1]: tilted &harr; inclined; inclinations &harr; proclivity, disposition.
